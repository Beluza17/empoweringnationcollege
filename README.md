**8. Scenario **  
  
A local small- to mid-size enterprise (SME) would like to have a web page and mobile app developed to advertise their business, receive requests for information from potential customers as well as provide quotes to the potential customers for services requested.    
  
The SME is an initiative by Precious Radebe to provide skills training for domestic workers and gardeners. Her parents and other elderly relatives were never given the chance to upskill themselves or follow a formal educational qualification, so this training school is her way of supporting similarly affected members from her community. The training she provides upskills domestic workers and gardeners by making them more marketable when seeking employment and enables them to be paid at a higher rate because of these  additional skills. They can also be entrepreneurs and setup their own small business utilising these newly obtained skills. Many employers would like to have their employees upskilled to offer more skilled services to the household.   
  
Customers (employers or employees) can select from a range of courses available. They can select more than one course. The more courses the customers select the more discount they receive.    
* 		· One course – no discount   
* 		  
* 		· Two courses – 5% discount   
* 		  
* 		· Three courses – 10% discount   
* 		  
* 		· More than three courses – 15% discount   
* 		  
  
The company’s name is “*Empowering the Nation*”. Precious states that the images, fonts and colours selected are very important and they should reflect the professional image and purpose of her business. The six-month programmes take place over 12 weeks and the short courses take six weeks. She does not have a logo, but she does provide a short history of her business:    
  
*Empowering the Nation was established in 2022 and offers courses in Johannesburg. Hundreds of domestic workers and gardeners have been trained* *on both the six-month long Learnerships and six-week Short Skills Training Programmes to empower themselves and can provide more marketable skills.   *
